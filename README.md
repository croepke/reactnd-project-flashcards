# Project

For this project I built a mobile application (tested for iOS) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks and take quizzes on those decks.

# Development

This application has been developed and tested for iOS on the iOS-simulator.

# Installation

To run the application please run the following commands (with Node.js, XCode and Expo already installed).

1. `git clone https://github.com/croepke/reactnd-project-flashcards.git`
2. cd into the cloned folder and run `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`
